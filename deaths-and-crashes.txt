This file contains things that have caused the Planar AI
to either die, or to crash. The intention is that looking
for patterns here will enable bugs or AI deficiencies to be
noticed. Things marked with a + are now fixed.

- Forgetting the location of a bugbear and being killed by
  it from 1hp
- Being stunned
  - Partially fixed; retry now works properly from this
- Invisible monsters
+ Getting stuck inside a shop
  + This is to do with either a lack of implementation of
    being able to pay for things, or bugs in PardonMe, or
    both. Why is PardonMe not working?
    + PardonMe now has a lot of shopkeeper logic, and handles
      this case correctly
- Failing to start up properly; is this a framework bug?
- Invisible monsters. More invisible monsters.
- Squeezing past a boulder and not knowing how to get back.
  - Planar will now smash boulders outside Soko to get back, but
    that's only a partial fix as it doesn't always have a pickaxe
+ Panicked after going downstairs for no obvious reason
  + This makes me even more suspicious that there's a
    caching bug related to changing level
    + This one's been fixed now, I think
- Bumping a shopkeeper when blind
  - This one happens relatively often. I wonder if there's an easy
    solution? You can often sort-of guess where a shop is by the
    location.
- Finding a bones file with the same shopkeeper, who still hates
  TAEBs. (Maybe we should #quit if we anger a shopkeeper, to avoid
  leaving nasty-to-TAEB bones?)
- Being made helpless (I'm not entirely sure how) when in a beehive
  and in melee with a nymph and scorpion, on critically low HP
- Being surrounded by a werewolf and its summon-storm, unable to cure
  lycanthropy due to having had to have prayed for help
- Killed by walking over a cockatrice corpse while blind.
  - We need a list of situations where moving around when blind is
    dangerous. Squares on which we've killed a cockatrice is one,
    shops is another.
    * 34179  TAEB-Val-Dwa-Fem-Law turned to stone in Sokoban on             
             level 8 [max 12].  Petrified by a cockatrice corpse.  122 [126]
    - Still Planar's best game ever, though.
- Being confused in Bigroom when on low health
  - It was doing just fine before it was confused, adopting a hit-
    and run tactic running around the edges as fast as possible,
    sniping at the enemies every now and then. But the confusion
    messed up its movements, so the hit-and-run broke down, and it
    died to being hit by the things it thought it could outrun.
- Digging into a shop
  - Does this require being able to detect shops at range?
  - We should at least check for pickaxe messages
- Killed by a thrown dagger while trying to regain HP (Rest|DefensiveElbereth)
- Didn't cause a death but: being chased by a faster monster (it
  miscounted the turns somehow)
- Repeatedly changing level and getting hit by a monster it couldn't
  remember just after the change
- Exploring while on very low HP and surrounded by monsters, after
  rejecting a bunch of other explore plans; it's not clear why this
  plan was thought by the bot to be safe (at a cost of 0.02hp, 2
  turns)
