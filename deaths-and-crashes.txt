This file contains things that have caused the Planar AI
to either die, or to crash. The intention is that looking
for patterns here will enable bugs or AI deficiencies to be
noticed.

- Being stunned
- Invisible monsters
- Getting stuck inside a shop
  - This is to do with either a lack of implementation of
    being able to pay for things, or bugs in PardonMe, or
    both. Why is PardonMe not working?
- Failing to start up properly; is this a framework bug?
